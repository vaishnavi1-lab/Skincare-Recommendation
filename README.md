# Skincare-Recommendation
The skincare recommendation system uses machine learning algorithms to analyze users' skin types, concerns, and preferences, providing tailored product suggestions. With a hybrid approach combining KNN, CNN, Transfer Learning, and content-based filtering, the system achieves 80% validation accuracy and enhances recommendation accuracy by 30%.
This project provides personalized skincare product recommendations based on user inputs like skin tone, type, and acne severity. It utilizes machine learning algorithms, including KNN, CNN, and Transfer Learning with EfficientNet B0, achieving a validation accuracy of 80% and training accuracy of 87.10%.
